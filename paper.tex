\begin{abstract}
The fabric of society relies on our ability to privately communicate with one another. Throughout our entire history as a species we have had the ability to do so, albeit limited by distance and latency. Technology has only in the past decades reached the speed and pervasiveness to enable truly private global communication, and now we must wrestle with the consequences.

Our digital infrastructure forms a substrate that connects us together, for better or worse. Technologies like the internet are almost overwhelmingly regarded as a betterment to our society. (TODO: CITE??) Contrary, as recent incidences of whistleblowing and conflict have shown, these technologies can be subverted and turned against us, being used to create terror. (TODO: more on data?)

When considering how to combat terrorism, it's important to remember the goal of those carrying out the actions. Creating terror, causing knee-jerk reactions, provoking radical changes. How can we say we are not giving into terror when we choose to sacrifice our liberty for our security? How can we say we are free when our most private communications are monitored to ensure we are not acting outside of the government's ideal view of society? How can we continue create good social change, such as universal suffrage was, in an atmosphere that includes suffocating surveilance?

In this paper, we explore how C-51 impacts the lives of normal citizens and activists.

\section*{Background}
In this decade and the last in light of major threats to the security of the public from individuals and organizations deemed as terrorists by the government, legislation has been passed in an attempt to quell such risks. While these laws may be well intentioned they may also erode the freedoms of individuals and defiantly have created a chilling effect. There is an argument to be had for both sides which must be explored. The age old question that must be asked once again is: is it more important so safeguard a right to free speech or the general safety and security of the broader public.

On the heels of a domestic terrorism attack on the parliament of Canada, in 2015 the Conservative government introduced a new bill C-51. The bill was largely touted as an anti-terrorism bill but included many dangerous provisions which feature overly broad wording or presume strong watchdogs on Canada's spy and surveillance agencies.

During the parliamentary processes which granted this bill royal assent on June 18, 2015 there were widespread demonstrations and protests as public awareness about the bill rose, and approval of the bill fell. (TODO: CITEME) The arguments made by protesters were that...

\section*{Undermining the Security of Canada}
The act defines "activity that undermines the security of Canada" to mean any of the following activities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item interference with the capability of the Government of Canada in relation to intelligence, defence, border operations, public safety, the administration of justice, diplomatic or consular relations, or the economic or financial stability of Canada;
    \item changing or unduly influencing a government in Canada by force or unlawful means;
    \item espionage, sabotage or covert foreign-influenced activities;
    \item terrorism;
    \item proliferation of nuclear, chemical, radiological or biological weapons;
    \item interference with critical infrastructure;
    \item interference with the global information infrastructure, as defined in section 273.61 of the National Defence Act;
    \item an activity that causes serious harm to a person or their property because of that person's association with Canada; and
    \item an activity that takes place in Canada and undermines the security of another state.
\end{enumerate}

After legitimate concerns cited the possibility of this being used to target non-violent domestic protests, such as the "Idle No More" movement or anti-pipeline protestors, a revision was added the language "For greater certainty, it does not include advocacy, protest, dissent and artistic expression." This clarification of language helped reduce the possibility for abuse, but does not eliminate it complete.

In order to further illustrate, consider where the line gets blurry, as in the following situation:

\begin{displayquote}
A First Nations band has chosen to block off an important shipping or logging road in protest of the constuction of a new oil pipeline. While this action certainly could be seen as undermining Canada's financial or economic stability, or endangering public safety, or even harming diplomatic relations if the pipeline was foreign owned. At the same time, this action is obviously a domestic protest and act of dissent.
\end{displayquote}

How does the bill characterize this event? Would the bill consider this "activity that undermines the security of Canada"? If not, at what point would it?

\section*{Information Sharing}
In the past, even in the past few decades, it woud have simply been impractical for a government to compile an accurate, detailed profile of a given person's life without considerable, targetted effort. In recent years this has changed, and now information sharing is considered a necessary feature of the government. \cite{total-awareness} Moreso, expansive technology companies such a Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have amassed a tremendous amount of data on citizens, marking such profiling as the norm, rather than the exception.

There is cause for concern with information sharing, even amongst government ministries. Despite providing the legalease to facilitate this sharing, between an open ended list of (at this time) 117 ministries and bodies, the bill provides no steps towards ensuring the reliability of the provided data, leading to a risk of mis-identification and false evidence.

This very mistake of incorrect information was partially the cause of the case of Canadian citizen Maher Arar, when the RCMP provided information that the future Inquiry deemed "unfortunate, and to put it mildly, totally unacceptable." \cite{arar}

It is reasonable to assert that information sharing can be a useful feature for investigations into terrorism or otherwise defined acivities which undermine the security of Canada. There are questions on how to facilitate this while still respecting the privacy of normal citizens and those acting under provisions around protest, dissent, and advocacy.
